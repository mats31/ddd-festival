===================

![Alt text](readme.png?raw=true "Readme cover")

Skyfall is my experiment for the 2017 Digital Design Days festival in Milano.
You can see it online [here](http://www.mathis-biabiany.fr/ddd-festival/).

It uses Three.js and Greensock as depencies.

After cloning install all dependencies :
```bash
npm i
```

## Task
### Start development
It starts a developement server with live reload.
```bash
npm start
```
### Prepare for deploy
```bash
npm run build
```

You are good to go !
